## tsai
A small "shell" to print out the syntax of a function in PHP using Reflection

At the moment, I just made a repository with the very-first implementation of it.


##### Usage

Basic usage below

```
$ php tsai.php 
> strlen
strlen :: str
> explode
explode :: separator -> str -> [limit]
> :t implode
implode :: glue -> pieces
> :q
Bye..
```
